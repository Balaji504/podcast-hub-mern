# podcast-hub-mern

Podcast Hub is a podcast application built on MERN. 

Aim: 

	- Build robust podcast application using React, Express/Node.js and MongoDB. Mainly as an exercise to become better at the stack and JS in general.

Planned features:

	- Multiple user support with validation using Passport.js
	- Add podcast feeds using an RSS URL or by browsing through a podcast API (need to find a good one, or scrap some data)
	- Allow users to save podcasts to their drive or stream through an embedded media player
	- Mark episodes as favourites or for later listening, implement a note system
	- Implement a timestamp feature similar to SoundCloud
	- Sharing or social component
	- Podcast feed monitor and alerts (eg. notify user when a new episode comes out - set reminders, etc)

Leaning outcomes:

	- Skill up with React for front end rendering
	- Learn how to use MongoDB as opposed to tradional relational databases like PostgreSQL
	- Learn methods of caching and validating data eg. when to reference database vs hitting a feed or API
	- Implement testing (TDD, automated, etc)
